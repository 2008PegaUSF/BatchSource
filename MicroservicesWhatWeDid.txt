Our goals for today was to learn about microservices and 
the netflix OSS stack that help us to manage microservices. 

We deployed a service : planet-one (as an example of Spring boot)

Our next step was to create a service registry 
	Eureka - to keep track of our other future services 

We created a slighlty more advance service: planet-two
	This service is meant to act as a psuedo dao layer.
	i.e. a (rest) controller that returns a list of objects. 

How to create a single point of access to all of our 
	services? We levaraged Zuul 

Zuul leveraged Eureka to find out which services to navigate to?
	WE further configured it to decide which paths we want 
	in the first place. 
Zuul also leverages Ribbon. To balance the load between seperate instances
	of services. 

Finally we wanted a service that levarages anotehr service. 

Planet-three:
	Used RestTemplate to retrieve infromation from planet-two 
	(i.e. our psuedo dao service)
	We used Zuul to find our end point 
	We used Hystrix, incase if planet-two failed. 

We did Zuul filtering. 
	Setting filter logic, trigger conditions, ordering of filters and type of filters
	(e.g. pre, post, etc. )
