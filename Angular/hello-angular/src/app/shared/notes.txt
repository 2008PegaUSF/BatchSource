Inversion Of Control (IoC)

Is the process of GIVING UP CONTROL of some functionality to another ENTITY
Real World Exampled: IoC would be like asking a Subway worker to make your sandwich, as opposed to 
                        doing it yourself at home. 

What is Dependency Injection (DI) design pattern?
    DI is a subset of IoC   
    The dpendency injection design pattern is SPECIFCALLY when the functionality you give up is 
    in control of your dependency. The other ENTITY will then inject your dependencies into you when the need arises.
