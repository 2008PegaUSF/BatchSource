Setting up Angular 

Open terminal in file space and open 

ng new [project_name]

Open terminal inside project folder 

ng serve -o --port 9001

"-o" : This will auto open angular in a tab 
"--port 9001" : Will change the port (default port is 4200)


What is a framework?
	A framework is a comprehensive library built to make coding complex applicaitons easier. 
	Allows you do VERY complex things with smaller lines of code

Framework vs Library?
	YOUR code will utilise library functionality to help it along 
	A FRAMEWORK will use YOUR code like a library to finetune its functionality

What is Angular?
	Angular is a javascript framework for building client applciations in HTML, CSS and javascript/typescript
	We use this framework because creating an application with just javascript can become cumbersome when it becomes very large
	Angular is component based. EACH PIECE of the htmp page will actually be a fragment referred as a "component".

What is a component?
	A component is a fragment of an HTML that will be used like buildingblock to build a FULL html page. 
	You can quickly interchange component to modify the html view. 
	Each component will consist of 3 files (and possibly one test file)

Component file naming convention:
	<component_name>.component.html <-- the html file
	<component_name>.component.css  <-- the css file
	<component_name>.component.ts   <-- the typescript file 

	<component_name>.component.spec.ts <-- Testing file 

Angular project foler structure:
	src : is for our source code, as you would expect
	e2e : means end to end testing (we won't be using this for now)
	node_modules : holds all the packages (libraries) your project needs to funciton properly (aka its dependencies)
	package.json: holds various scripts AND your dependencies configurations
