To transfer files we input the following command:

scp -i <file/path/key>.pem <file/path/myFile> ec2-user@<endpoint>:</file/path/inside/ec2-user/newFileNameInEC2>

scp : Secure Copy 

Note:
	Ensure that you add "ec2-user", this will give you persmission to send over files. 
	The filepath you specify in the EC2 will be where the file will be stored.


Connect to the ec2 to ensure that the file has been transferred.
ssh -i <key>.pem ec2-user@<endpoint>
