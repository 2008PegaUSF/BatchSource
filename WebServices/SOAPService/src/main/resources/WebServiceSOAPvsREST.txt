Service:
	Performing an action on behalf of someone. 

In the context of programming:
	Where an application, software or hardware offers functionality 
	through a network. 

Web Service:
	Is an applciation, software or hardware that shares its functionality
	through a network, in this case the internet.

Why not send service via a jar file?
		Update Anomalies
			I can be stuck with an old version
		Platform dependence
			What to do if I have c#
			What to do if I have Python 
		Services that require DB access
			Nobody wants to send their db credentials...

Main Downside?
	You need internet

SOA-Service Orientated Architecutre 
	Technique for building applications using loosely coupled services

Benefits of SOA:
	Modular Business Services
	Code Resuse 
	Scalability
	Language Independent 
	

REST vs SOAP

REST? Representational State Transfer
	An architectural style protocol

	What kinds of information can you send over? 
	JSON, XML, Anything that can be represented as a string,
	including Ben's patented format ??. 
	
	TANGENT WARNING[
	Why JSON? JavaScript Object Notation, it's the STRING representation
		of an object. Difference between water and a picture of water. 
		 
		You can unpack the JSON to something useful, 
		ITS A STANDAR	]

	Transfer Protocl?
		Is only HTTP/HTTPS.

	Contract bound?
		It is not contract bound 

TANGENT[ API is a way of interacting with something]

	What makes an API RESTful? 
	1) Stateless: does not retain/store any data bout the latest HTP request
	2) Uniform-Interface: Each entitiys API should follow the same pattern, no operation should have more than 1 URL
	3) Client-Server: They are seperate entities
	4) Layered-system : Client cannot tell whether it is connected to the original server or another server
	5) Cacheable: REsources must declare themsleves as cacheable. 
	6) (Optional) Code on demand.

	If you don't meed all these conditions, then you're REST based. 




SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocl 
	An XML-based message protocol 

	What information format can we send over?
		XML, only SOAP based XML. 
	Transfer protocol?
		Any protocol, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, My own protocol.
	Contract bound?
		YES uses WSDL. Web Service Description Language. 
		
		Contract-first: define the contract, then make the service around it
		Contract-last: create the service, then make the contract

	TANGENT[
		JSON: {"key":"values"}
		(Simple XML): <Planet><name>"Mercury"</name></Planet/>

		SOAP message
			<envelope>
				<header>
					//metadata, optionally can enable additional security
				</header>

				<body>
					//the message content
					<fault> //optional, how to hanlde errors and exceptions
				</body>
			</envelope>

		SOAP wsdl:
			<definitions>
				<types>
				<message>
				<porttypes>
					<operations>
				<binding>
				<service>
					<port>
