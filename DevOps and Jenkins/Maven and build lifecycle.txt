What is Maven?

Maven is Yiddish for "accumulator of knowledge:, developed by Apache Software foundation since 2003

So far, we've used it as a dependency manager. It handles all of our dependeicy easily by automatically 
downloading the appropriate libraries from remote repo. 

But Maven is also a build automation tool. It allows us to compile our projects, will all the dpendencies inside it, 
	into a distributable format, i.e. jar or war files.
