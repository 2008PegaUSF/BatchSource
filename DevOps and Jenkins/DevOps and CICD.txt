DevOps:

DevOps is how code is being developed and deployed. Nowadays, it's tightly integrated with CICD pipelines
(Continous integration, continous deployment/delivery). It automates the steps inside the software deployment
lifecycle. 

Before CICD?
	Nigtly Build:
		Developers do some work -> they commit the changes to source code ->
		code is pulled every night and build over-night (feedback occurs once a day)

CICD:
	We can build the project after every commit

Jenkins?
	Continous Integration tool (allows continous development, tests and deployment of newly created codes),
	plygins built for CI purposes e.g. build, continous testing, continous integrat, version control, deployment, etc. 

	Open source! We get all the options in the world, but we have to configure all the options. 

Other tools (open source):
		Bamboo - CI tool runs multiple builds in parallel (for faster integration), test different builds in different enviornments quicker
		Jenkins - Automation for projects (Hudson is original version of Jenkins)
		BuildBot - Framework for automating software build, tests and release processes
		Apache Gump - Specifically in Java (API and functionality testing)
		Travis CI - For stored code in GitHub (build and testing)
		Buddy 
		AWS pipeline


Feature of Jenkins:
	Easy installation (self-contained Java-based program)
	Easy configuration (via its web interface)
	Plugins (lot and lots of plugins, can be found in update center)
	Extensible (can be extended via tis plugin atrchitecutre)
	Distributed (can be easily distributed across your network)

Jenkins Pipeline:
	Code commit (to a git server)
	Jenkins will build a verion of your porject 
	Jenkins will test your project (unit testing)
	RElease - create a release nevironment 
	Deploy/Deliver environment
