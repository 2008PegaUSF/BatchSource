Microservices 

Levarging Spring Boot 

I'm going to make 3 business services 

2 other services that leveage Eureka dn Zuul 

Eureka 
Zuul 
Hystrix 
Ribbon 

Eureka
	problem: As a developer or maintainer, you want a simple way to track all of your service instances

	Is a service registry. It keep track of all of your instances and their health. It acts as a phone book. 


Zuul 
	problem: We don't want the user to know about your distributed system, they should experience it as a 
		monolothic application, i.e. a single endpoint. 

	We need a unified API gateway, we only need to access a single port to recieve information

Ribbon 

	problem: How do we make sure that every instance of our service is handling simliar amounts of traffic.

	load balancer. 

Hystrix

	Circuit breaker.

	Is a load balancer. It handles traffic for our services, so that they don't crash. 



Mini Assignment 

	I want you to create 4 services that are registered in Eureka, and also route managed by Zuul. 
	I want you to create a service that will persist data (to a database) - acts as a repo 
	I want you to create a seperate service, that hardcodes in dummy data (backup repo) 
	I want your other services to leverage the "dao" services to execute their own logic. 
		Inside of that service, use Hystrix to switch from the unsafe dao service to the 
		safe hardcoded dao service. 
	I want you to create a post filter in Zuul, that informs me on what endpoint I'm pinging.
